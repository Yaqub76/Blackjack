        <h2>Objective</h2>
        <p>The objective of Blackjack is to have a hand value of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. The player wins if their hand value is higher than the dealer's, but loses if it's lower or if they go over 21.</p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Gameplay</h2>
        <p>The player decides whether to hit (take another card) or stay (keep their current hand). The player can hit as many times as they want, but if their hand value goes over 21, they lose automatically.</p>
        <p>Once the player decides to stay, the dealer will draw everytime you click stay until their hand value is at least 17. If the dealer's hand value goes over 21, they lose automatically.</p>
        <p>The player with the highest hand value that's 21 or less wins the game.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Scoring</h2>
        <p>Each card has a numerical value: 2-10 are worth their face value, while face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 and Aces can be worth 1 or 11 depending on what's more favorable for the player.</p>
        <p>The hand value is the sum of the values of the individual cards in the hand.</p>
